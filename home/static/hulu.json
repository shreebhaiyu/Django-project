He inhabits the East End of London, currently racked by crisis -- bands of thugs who rove throughout the streets, spreading violence and terror among the citizenry. As Jamie soon discovers, however, these aren't ordinary hooligans wearing demon masks, but actual demons. The young man packs heat and then considers going to the authorities, but before he can do so, the monsters turn up, attack him, and murder his mother. Then, one of their leaders, Papa B. (Joseph Mawle), approaches Jamie to make a deal: permanent removal of the birthmark in exchange for the performance of some evil deeds. Jamie consents, but has no idea just how vile and cruel those tasks are until he has already signed up. At the time of its release, Heartless was the first feature from Ridley since his 1995 outing The Passion of Darkly Noon.","program_description_type":"Plot Synopsis"}],"movie_rating":{"rating_type":"MPAA","rating":"NR"},"tv_rating":null,"genres":["Horror","suspense/thriller"],"services":["amazon","hulu","itunes","youtube"],"air_date":null,"release_date":[{"country":"US","date":"20101119"},{"country":"GB","date":"20100521"}],"season_number":0,"start_year":0,"end_year":0,"network":null,"season_title":null,"alias_title":"","alias_title_2":"","alias_title_3":"","alias_title_4":"","images":[{"active_date":2014,"expiration_date":2099,"number_of_people":0,"zoom_level":1,"cast_weight":0.0,"caption":"","credit":"","last_updated_date":null,"primary_image":false,"format_id":"1391895","image_type":"Poster Art","url":"http://cps-static.rovicorp.com/2/Open/1SPS/VT/AMG/_derived_jpg_q90_444x444_m0/12137181_PA_Heartless.jpg","width":308,"height":444,"format":"jpg","aspect_ratio":"1401:2015","orientation":"Portrait","iso_2_char_language":"EN","type":"Poster Art"},{"active_date":2014,"expiration_date":2099,"number_of_people":0,"zoom_level":1,"cast_weight":0.0,"caption":"","credit":"","last_updated_date":null,"primary_image":false,"format_id":"1391903","image_type":"Poster Art","url":"http://cps-static.rovicorp.com/2/Open/1SPS/VT/AMG/_derived_jpg_q90_584x800_m0/12137181_PA_Heartless.jpg","width":556,"height":800,"format":"jpg","aspect_ratio":"1401:2015","orientation":"Portrait","iso_2_char_language":"EN","type":"Poster Art"}],"external_ratings":[{"type":"imdb","votes":8460,"rating":6.0,"max_rating":10}]},{"id":3481348129,"show_type":"SE","series_id":19034491,"season_program_id":"3481348105","variant_parent_id":"0","title_parent_id":"0","group_id":2522336784,"is_group_language_primary":true,"group_size":7,"long_title":"New Girl","medium_title":"New Girl","short_title":"New Girl","grid_title":"New Girl","original_title":"New Girl","original_episode_title":"House Hunt","category":"Other","sports_subtitle":"","episode_title":"House Hunt","episode_number":"601","run_time":1800,"release_year":2016,"record_language":"EN","event_date":"","hdtv_level":"720p","audio_level":"Dolby 5.1","threed_level":"None","movie_type":"","color_type":"Color","official_program_url":"http://www.fox.com/new-girl/","additional_program_url":"","part_number":0,"total_number_of_parts":0,"iso_3_char_language":"ENG","description":[{"program_description":"Nick returns early from his summer in New Orleans, forcing Jess to do everything in her power to keep her mind off him.

Kat Ellis (Debra Messing) is a woman in her mid-thirties living in New York City and has had more than her share of romantic problems -- enough so that she's gotten word that her younger half-sister Amy (Amy Adams) is getting married, and that her mother Bunny (Holland Taylor) and father Victor (Peter Egan) want to fix her up with someone so she won't look alone and miserable for the big day. Adding insult to injury, Kat learns that the best man at the ceremony will be Jeffrey (Jeremy Sheffield), a former boyfriend who cruelly dumped her without warning two years before. Determined not to show up alone, Kat swallows her pride and hires Nick Mercer (Dermot Mulroney), a professional escort, who will pose as her boyfriend for a $6,000 fee. Kat and Nick fly to England for the wedding, and her family and friends are all struck by how charming, handsome, and personable Nick is -- and Kat begins wondering if their relationship has to be all business; however, as it turns out, Nick understands Kat far better than she expects. The Wedding Date was based on the novel Asking for Trouble by British author Elizabeth Young.","program_description_type":"Plot Synopsis"}],"movie_rating":{"rating_type":"MPAA","rating":"PG13"},"tv_rating":null,"genres":["Comedy","Romance","chick flick"],"services":["amazon","hulu","itunes","vudu","youtube"],"air_date":null,"release_date":[{"country":"US","date":"20050204"},{"country":"SE","date":"20050415"}],"season_number":0,"start_year":0,"end_year":0,"network":null,"season_title":null,"alias_title":"","alias_title_2":"","alias_title_3":"","alias_title_4":"","images":[{"active_date":2011,"expiration_date":2099,"number_of_people":0,"zoom_level":2,"cast_weight":0.0,"caption":"","credit":"","last_updated_date":null,"primary_image":false,"format_id":"1391895","image_type":"Poster Art","url":"http://cps-static.rovicorp.com/2/Open/NBC%20Universal%20Distribution/Movies/The%20Wedding%20Date/_derived_jpg_q90_444x444_m0/TheWeddingDate-PosterArt.jpg","width":333,"height":444,"format":"jpg","aspect_ratio":"3:4","orientation":"Portrait","iso_2_char_language":"EN","type":"Poster Art"},{"active_date":2011,"expiration_date":2099,"number_of_people":0,"zoom_level":2,"cast_weight":0.0,"caption":"","credit":"","last_updated_date":null,"primary_image":false,"format_id":"1391903","image_type":"Poster Art","url":"http://cps-static.rovicorp.com/2/Open/NBC%20Universal%20Distribution/Movies/The%20Wedding%20Date/_derived_jpg_q90_584x800_m0/TheWeddingDate-PosterArt.jpg","width":584,"height":778,"format":"jpg","aspect_ratio":"3:4","orientation":"Portrait","iso_2_char_language":"EN","type":"Poster Art"}],"external_ratings":[{"type":"imdb","votes":34411,"rating":6.1,"max_rating":10}]},{"id":1449829380,"show_type":"MO","series_id":0,"season_program_id":"0","variant_parent_id":"0","title_parent_id":"1449829380","group_id":1430941111,"is_group_language_primary":true,"group_size":1,"long_title":"Miss You Already","medium_title":"Miss You Already","short_title":"Miss You Already","grid_title":"Miss You","original_title":"Miss You Already","original_episode_title":"","category":"Film","sports_subtitle":"","episode_title":"","episode_number":"","run_time":6720,"release_year":2015,"record_language":"EN","event_date":"","hdtv_level":"None","audio_level":"None","threed_level":"","movie_type":"Theatrical","color_type":"Color","official_program_url":"http://www.missyoualreadymovie.com/","additional_program_url":"https://www.facebook.com/MissYouAlreadyFilm","part_number":0,"total_number_of_parts":0,"iso_3_char_language":"ENG","description":[{"program_description":"The friendship of two women is challenged when one becomes sick and the other starts a family.","program_description_type":"Generic Description"},{"program_description":"In this moving, heartfelt comedy-drama, childhood best friends Jess and Milly experience life-changing events that cause their friendship to be tested.

On that fateful evening, the parents of little Lana Lang were killed; Lex Luthor, son of billionaire business mogul Lionel Luthor (John Glover), was rendered totally bald; and on the farm of Jonathan and Martha Kent (John Schneider, Annette O'Toole), a spaceship landed, bearing a child from the planet Krypton. Now it is 2001: Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk) is the high school homecoming queen; swinging bachelor Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) is in charge of his father's local fertilizer plant; and the alien child who crash-landed on the Kent farm has been raised as the couple's own son, Clark Kent (Tom Welling). Aware that their adopted son is possessed of awesome powers far beyond those of mortal men, Martha and Jonathan have raised Clark in a virtual cocoon, prohibiting him from participating in any sort of contact sports; as a result, the boy has the reputation of a gawky nerd, and is extremely self-conscious and full of trepidation about his place in the world. In this opening episode of the Superman-inspired TV series Smallville, teenager Clark Kent becomes a close friend of Lex Luthor after saving the young playboy's life, and also endeavors to protect Lana and the rest of his high school friends from an electrified lunatic who was victimized by a Halloween \"hazing\" on the same night that the meteors fell.","program_description_type":"Plot
